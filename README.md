# :rocket: Welcome to Big Data Analytics Class! :watermelon::icecream:

This is the repository for all students to learn about homework/ assignment system. In this project, you, the student, are bound to use Git version control system in order to complete your projects and assignments.

Use this repository to introduce yourself, in pythonic way! Your first assignment is to write a function to that will return your name! Similarly, you can come up with anything more fancier than just a function, but thats up to you!

## Outline of this Project

This project will teach you how to upload your assignments and the first assignment. Here you go.

2. How to upload assignments

## First Assignment Instructions

Welcome to your first assignment! In this assignment, you have to introduce yourself in pythonic way! As mentioned above your mission is to introduce yourself by making a greeting function and calling that function as greeting.

Following is your checkmark.

1. Make a function and use it to print your name.
2. Rename this file as `Instructions.md`. Create a new `README.md` file.
3. Commit your changes and push your code to GitHub.
4. Don't forget to upload it to Blackboard as well.

### More on step 1

You are free to use any tool including Jupyter Notebook, or a simple python file to do this assignment. You may go fancy with your code, as long as your code outputs your `full name` when it runs.

### More on step 2

A `README` file, is an introductory file to give more information about what that repository is. Create one and describe what you have done for this project. 

To learn more about the purpose of `README` files, go have a read at [creating a README file](https://medium.com/@latoyazamill/how-to-create-a-readme-md-file-37cffa2d7ab4) article. To learn more about markdown, look at this [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). A very nice emoji cheatsheet for GitHub markdown is available at this [gist file](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908).

## What are all these other files?

Following table is will give it a meaning for each file.

File | Description |
---- | ----------- |
README.md ** | A descriptive file to give an introduction of current project/ assignment. 
Instructions.md ** | A copy of current README.md file. 
LICENCE ** | The licence of the file that every project should have.
.gitignore | The file to control which files should be ignored by Git.
*.py | Any python file you would use for your assignments
*.ipynb | Any Jupyter Notebook file that you may use for assignments

** Every project/ assignment needs to have these files. It is a good practice to keep them with your project.
